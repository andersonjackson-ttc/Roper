In it's current state, the scheduling spreadsheet turn in should have a mixture of protected sheets:
This is due to the fact that the buttons on the unprotected pages rewrite the cells so that once they are
protected the vba cannot alter them. Protection isn't necessarily needed on these pages however. Just the pages
where cell formulas could be altered.
